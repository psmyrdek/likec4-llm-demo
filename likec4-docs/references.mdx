LikeC4 uses the lexical scope, with hoisting, almost like in JavaScript.

### Scope

To understand references, we need to understand scopes first.  
Example:

```likec4
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
}
```

Every element is unique in the model, so we can add a relationship referencing them, like:

```likec4 'frontend -> api'
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
  frontend -> api
}
```

But if we add `service2` with another `api`:

```diff lang="likec4"
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
+  service service2 {
+    component api
+  }

  frontend -> api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' not found
}
```

The reference is ambiguous, as there are two `api` components in the model.

Every element creates a new scope inside `{...}`, so `api` is unique inside `service1` and `service2`,
but not in the scope of `model`.

We can resolve by moving the relationship to the scope of `service2`:

```likec4 {9-11}
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
  service service2 {
    component api

    frontend -> api // ✅ This is OK,
                    //    'api' is unique in 'service2'
                    //    'frontend' is unique in 'model'
  }
}
```

### Hoisting

<Aside>
  **Hoisting** is a mechanism that moves the reference to the top of the scope.
</Aside>

In LikeC4, the element, besides being hoisted in its scope, also _"bubbles"_ to the upper scopes, if it stays unique.

We may reference something that is not yet declared but will be hoisted later.  
The relationship on line 8 references `graphql` defined below on line 15:

```likec4 showLineNumbers {8,17} copy
model {

  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend

    frontend -> api // ✅ This is OK, references to 'api' from 'service1'
    frontend -> graphql // ✅ This is OK, references to unique 'graphql'
  }

  frontend -> api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is ambiguous

  service service2 {
    component api
    component graphql

    frontend -> api  // ✅ This is OK, references to 'api' from 'service2'
  }

}
```

<Aside>
Lines 7 and 17 are the same: `frontend -> api`  
But they reference to different elements:  
{'-'} Line 7 to `service1.api`  
{'-'} Line 17 to `service2.api`
</Aside>

### Fully qualified names

Top-level elements (placed directly in the `model` block) are available globally (explained later in [Workspace](/dsl/workspace)).  

To reference nested elements we use their fully qualified names (FQN).

Example:

```likec4 {11,12}
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend
  }
  service service2 {
    component api
  }

  frontend -> api // ⛔️ Error: 'api' not found
  frontend -> service1.api // ✅ This is OK
  frontend -> service2.api // ✅ This is OK
}
```

Or even:

```likec4 {5}
model {
  service service1 {
    component api
    component frontend {
      -> service2.api
    }
  }
  service service2 {
    component api
  }
}
```

Some parts may be omitted, if FQN stays unique:

```likec4
model {
  service service {
    component backend1  {
      component api
    }
    component backend2  {
      component api
      component graphql
    }
  }

  frontend -> service.backend1.api // ✅ Non-ambiguous fully qualified name

  frontend -> backend1.api  // ✅ This is OK, 'api' is unique in 'backend1',
                            //    and 'backend1' is unique in the model
                            //    We may omit 'service'

  frontend -> backend2.api  // ✅ This is also OK

  frontend -> service.api   // ⛔️ Error: 'api' is ambiguous in 'service'

  frontend -> service.graphql // ✅ This is also OK, we omit 'backend2'
                              //    as 'graphql' is unique in 'service'
}
```

<Aside type='caution'>
While omitting FQN-parts makes code better looking and references shorter,  
it may be error-prone when you refactor the model

_Sure, only if you have same-named elements_

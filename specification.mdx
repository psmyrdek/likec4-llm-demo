In the `specification` you define your notation.

## Element kind

The `element` defines the kind that can be used across the model.

```likec4 copy
specification {

  // Define whatever you want
  element user
  element cloud
  element system
  element application
  element component
  element controller
  element microservice
  element queue
  element restapi
  element graphqlMutation
  element repository
  element database
  element pgTable

}
```

Element kinds are required for the [model](/dsl/model).

## Relationship

```likec4
specification {
  relationship async
  relationship subscribes
  relationship is-downstream-of
}
```

More in the [relationships](/dsl/relationships/#relationship-kinds)

## Tag

Tags may be used to mark, group, filter elements/relationships/views, or give some additional semantics, like `#deprecated`, `#epic-123` or `#team2`.

```likec4
specification {

  tag deprecated
  tag epic-123
  tag team2

}
```

## Color

Custom colors could be defined to extend built in themes. Being defined in specification they could be used later along with the theme colors.

```likec4
specification {
  color custom-color #808
  color another-color #440

  element person {
    style {
      color custom-color
    }
  }
}
```
